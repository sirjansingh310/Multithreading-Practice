//        While creating synchronized methods within classes that you create is an easy and effective
//        means of achieving synchronization, it will not work in all cases. To understand why, consider
//        the following. Imagine that you want to synchronize access to objects of a class that was not
//        designed for multithreaded access. That is, the class does not use synchronized methods.(ex some classes that are not "ThreadSafe")
//        Further, this class was not created by you, but by a third party, and you do not have access to
//        the source code. Thus, you canâ€™t add synchronized to the appropriate methods within the
//        class. How can access to an object of this class be synchronized? Fortunately, the solution to
//        this problem is quite easy: You simply put calls to the methods defined by this class inside a
//        synchronized block.
